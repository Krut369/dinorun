## üé• Why is the code different from the YouTube series?

This project began as a learning journey with Flame. While building it, I decided to create a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiZZKL9HLmWOmQgYxWHuOHOWsUUlhCCOY). The game and videos were originally developed using Flame v0.28. However, Flame underwent major updates, including a full migration to null safety and a new API.

To keep things up-to-date:

* üîÅ I rewrote the game from scratch using the latest Flame version.
* üì¶ The original version is preserved on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/ufrshubham/dino_run/tree/main).

This way, new learners can follow a working codebase and still benefit from the series.
